In this Workshop 4 at home part of 2 of the workshop we are using the skills to 
create different constructor like we had two in this DIY for default and one to 
accept the array from the main.cpp. We learned about destructors which are used
if some condition is not met so we used to delete the object so we don't have memory leak 
issues. We learned how to inialize variables given from the main.cpp using set method, which 
takes the parameters. We have added queries function such as getLocation, getBattery, getBrush, isActive, and isValid
which will return us variables which helps the int report global function which 
takes the variables to form a array to print out the variables.
