Reflection Workshop 8 - Part 2
Student Name: Vasantharajan Sharmilann


In our class and in this workshop we were introduced into how to use virtual function our modules, 
which also includes creating an abstract base class. In this workshop we declared our virtual function 
our iAccount.h. We linked those function to other function in order to work on the function. I did have error with 
Create Account function. The error was getting was 'CheuqingAccount not instanitial no virtual overrider' and 'SavingsAccount 
not instiate no virtual overrider found.' I realized that my declaration for my iAccount createAccount was incorrect. 
I have to changed it to iAccount* createAccount, previous i used virtual as rest of the function.
